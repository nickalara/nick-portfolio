                        <p align="justify">
                            I am a web developer with experience building full stack applications on C# .NET Core, and
                            specializing in front end development using React. I initially learned Vue, but over time I
                            favored React's structure. I recently decided to try Angular and I am quite enjoying it. If
                            that sounds all-over-the-place, I would rather it be a testament to my ability to work with
                            a wide range of technologies and to learn quickly. I've completed numerous courses on Amazon
                            Web Services and I hope to pass my upcoming certification exam.

                            Ever since a youth I was capitavated by tech, from video games to computers to electronics.
                            I used to deconstruct my video game consoles just to see what was under the hood. My
                            grandfather taught me about computers back in the days of Windows 95 and 98, and around that
                            same time was when my step-father let me "help" him build his computers. By middle school I
                            was hacking the family's home computer to bypass the parental controls and use the system
                            freely. In high school I learned how to edit my MySpace page by injecting my profile with
                            HTML and CSS. I've built and modified dozens of computers for myself, friends, and family.
